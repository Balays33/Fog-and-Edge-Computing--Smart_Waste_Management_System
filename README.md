 Fog and Edge Computing  – Smart Waste Management System
 
Smart Waste Management System Fog Simulation based on iFogSim
This repository stores the source code of the simulation that was implemented for the Fog and Edge Computing module of the Cloud Computing postgraduade course at the National College of Ireland.

This simulation is based on iFogSim.

iFogSim is an open-source Toolkit for Modeling and Simulation of Resource Management Techniques in Internet of Things, Edge and Fog Computing Environments.

Prerequsites
Git
Java 8
Eclipse

How to install iFogSim and the simulation?
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Balays33/Fog-and-Edge-Computing--Smart_Waste_Management_System.git

Open Eclipse and import the WasteManangment.java Java project into Eclipse. Note: Make sure you import the Eclipse project into Eclipse, rather than creating a new Eclipse project.
If needed, include the JARs (except the CloudSim ones) to the buildpath of the Eclipse project.
How to run the Smart Waste Management System Fog simulation?
For the requirements of this simulation, the class org.fog.test.perfeval.WasteManangment was created. Additionally, many files of the iFogSim were modified for bug fixes and improvements. Thus, the CarParkingFogSimulation must run on the modified version of iFogSim that is hosted in this repository. Important: Do not copy and run the org.fog.test.perfeval.WasteManangment class in a vanilla iFogSim installation.

Run the main method of the org.fog.test.perfeval.WasteManangment class, using the modified iFogSim that is hosted in this repository.
